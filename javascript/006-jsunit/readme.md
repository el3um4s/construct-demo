# JsUnit

* **c3p** [jsunit.c3p](source/c3p/jsunit.c3p)
* **demo** [link](demo)


C3 does not allow to use Unit Test regularly. I think it's a problem, but I don't know how to fix it.

Searching the net I found an interesting article: **[JsUnit (s): The First JavaScript Unit Testing Libraries](https://medium.com/@denny.headrick/jsunit-s-the-first-javascript-unit-testing-libraries-af57d51d6ea1)**.

I decided to integrate the first JsUnit in C3: this is the result.

I have not yet decided whether this experiment will have a follow-up. For the time being, I'll just keep it for the future.
